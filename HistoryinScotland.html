							<h2> The Risings in Scotland </h2>
							<p> Why Scottish people should watch Outlander </p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">									
							<p>			
			The TV-series Outlander has given people around the world an insight into Scottish history, and an (perhaps surprisingly) accurate one at that. 
				Strangely enough, this has led to many foreign people having a better picture of Scottish history than Scottish people themselves! How and why? <br>
					Many Scottish people do not know much about the Risings and the Battle of Culloden. They don't know the timeline of the Risings, who were involved, 
								nor why the battle even took place.<br>
					It appears that in the Highlands, some schools do teach their students about the Risings and Culloden.
					Some of these places are very close to the site of Culloden, which explains why they have this subject in their curriculum.
					However, many schools actually still teach mostly English history and very little on the history of Scotland itself.<br>
						<center>Are Scottish schools in this way actually unwittingly contributing to the decline of the "Scottish culture"?</center> <br>
								
					Be sure to watch the video below to learn more details about this! <br> If you're interested, also read the comments;
					there are Scottish people sharing their own experiences with their educational system, and they can explain it much better 
					than I can. <br>
