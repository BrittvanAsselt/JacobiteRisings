							<h2> The History of the Risings </h2>
							<p> a Quick Overview </p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
							 From Braveheart to Outlander, Scotland is often depicted as the land of romantic warriors. 
						Tall Scotsmen, sometimes with flaming hair, fighting a seemingly hopeless battle are prominently featured in modern popular culture (think HBO or Hollywood). <br>
								<center>Is this a purely romanticized image of Scottish history? </center><br>
								<center>What do actual Scottish people think of this? Do they even know about it?</center> <br>
								<br>
  For the second question: go to <a href="HistoryinScotland.html">Scottish History in Scotland: where is it?</a> To answer the first question, we will take a closer look at an important moment in Scottish history: the Jacobite Risings and the infamous battle they led to, the Battle of Culloden.<br> 
  These Risings (rebellions) took place between 1688 and 1746 in Scotland, and the goal of these uprisings was to return James II of England and the VII of Scotland, and later his descendants, to the throne of Great Britain.  
								The Jacobites (from <i>Jacobus</i>, the Latin form of James) supported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England">James II of England</a> and later his descendants, but James had been deposed in 1688. 
	James had been the last Catholic British monarch, as his daughter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_II_of_England">Mary II</a> and her husband <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England">William of Orange</a>, who replaced him, were protestants.
	While James had been tolerant of Protestant belief, his daughter and her husband would suppress Catholicism as soon as they became monarchs.
	The rebellions were thus not just a battle for <i>who</i> held the throne, but also in a way for the level of tolerance both religions should get.
The rebellions came to a halt with the Rising of 1745, also known as the Forty-five Rebellion or just the ’45 (Scottish Gaelic: <i>Bliadhna Theàrlaich</i>, ‘The year of Charles’) and the ensuing battle at Culloden.

								<h3>The Beginning of the '45</h3>
								<p>This uprising was led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart">Charles Edward Stuart</a>, grandson of James, who wanted the throne back for his father, 
									also named James - British monarchy can get a tad confusing. 
	The uprising would pit Jacobites against government forces. Interesting and important to keep in mind is that this was <u>not</u> a war of Scots versus English. 
	The Jacobite army consisted of both north-eastern and lowland Scots, Irish and English.
	The government forces consisted not only of English, but also of Scottish men who did not agree with James (and Charles).
	Charles, also called ‘the Young Pretender’ or ‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’, started his rebellion in August 1745 when he arrived in Scotland. 
	After capturing Edinburgh and winning the battle of Prestonpans, the Jacobites decided to invade England. They made it until Derby before deciding to turn back. 
	In order to convince them to invade England, Charles had promised the Jacobites additional support from the French and from English Jacobites, but this support never showed. 
	As the Jacobites were afraid their retreat might be cut off, the majority voted to turn back to Scotland. They won another victory in January 1746 at Falkirk, and around this time their numbers peaked at around 9000-14000. 
	During the rebellion, the Royal Navy had blocked several foreign ships coming with food and monetary support for the Jacobites. While a few French ships managed to evade the blockade, this meant that 
				the Jacobites were short on food and money to pay their men by spring. The leadership soon agreed that giving battle was their best option at this point.
				These events would lead to the <a href="Culloden.html">Battle of Culloden</a> on the 16th of April 1746.	</p>
